## 会计等式和会计要素

会计等式里面有“资产、负债、所有者权益”就叫会计要素，它是对所有经济活动的分类。等式中资产在等式左边，负债和所有者权益在等式右边，并且每个会计要素增减方向是固定的，资产增加必须在借方，负债和所有者权益增加必须在贷方。

## 借记和贷记交易

银行在央行存的钱是属于“存放央行存款”属于银行的资产。稍有会计基础的同学就知道，资产类科目是“借方增加，贷方减少，余额反映在借方”（这点一定要记住，因为清算就是一套账务处理流程）。

而借贷记交易是站在提出者的角度来说了：

> 1. “提出借记”就是跨行收款，提出银行的借方发生额增加；
> 2. 这类交易一般是针对“应收账款”，我们收到一张到期兑付的银行汇票、本票、支票后，到期去银行做跨行收款。
> 3. “提出贷记”就是跨行付款，提出银行的贷方发生额减少；这类最为常见，我们给别人转账、采购付款就是用的贷记交易完成跨行转账。
> 4. “被借记行”就是被人借记收款的银行（还是提出方的角度哦，别弄反了，反了就晕了）做借记交易一般都是有前提的，比如应收账款的资金提前存放在“被借记行”的账户内，或者“付款人、提出行、提入行”签订协议，定期在付款人账户上扣款。
> 5. “被贷记行”就是被人贷记付款的银行（依然是提出行的角度）被贷记行接受贷记交易最干脆，只要账号和姓名验证正确就直接入账，账号错误就挂账次日发起退票退回去。

### Debits and Credits Explained…But First, Accounts

The 5 main types of accounts are assets, expenses, revenue (income), liabilities, and equity. 

- Asset Accounts
Assets are items that provide future economic benefits to a company, such as cash, accounts receivable, inventory, and equipment.

- Liability Accounts 
Liabilities are obligations that the company is required to pay, such as accounts payable, loans payable, and payroll taxes. 

- Equity Accounts
In accounting, owner’s equity (or shareholders’ equity) represents the money or property that could be returned to owners (or shareholders) if all of the company’s assets were liquidated and all of its debts were paid off. 

- Revenue Accounts
Revenue accounts are accounts related to income earned from the sale of products and services. 

- Expense Accounts
Expenses are the costs of operations that a business incurs to generate revenues. Examples include advertising, rent, and wages.

A debit to your bank account occurs when you use funds from the account to buy something or pay someone. When your bank account is debited, money is taken out of the account. The opposite of a debit is a credit, in which case money is added to your account.

When you hear your banker say, “I’ll credit your checking account,” it means the transaction will increase your checking account balance. Conversely, if your bank debits your account (e.g., takes a monthly service charge from your account) your checking account balance decreases.

### What is a debit?

In double-entry accounting, debits (dr) record all of the money flowing into an account. So, if your business were to take out a $5,000 small business loan, the cash you receive from that loan would be recorded as a debit in your cash, or assets, account.

### What is a credit?

Credits (cr) record money that flows out of an account. To use that same example from above, if you received that $5,000 loan, you would record a credit of $5,000 in your liabilities account.
